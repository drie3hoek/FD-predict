Installation of prediction tools

0) Before you can build these tools you need to install the following packages:
   i)	Zlib library (libz.a on Cygwin or zlib.lib on Windows) and header file (zlib.h) from http://zlib.net
		or from http://libpng.download/src
   ii)	Jpeg library (libjpeg.a or libjpeg.lib) and header files (jpeglib.h) from http://www.ijg.org/files
   iii)	Png library (libpng16.a or libpng.lib) and header files (png.h  pngconf.h  pnglibconf.h) from
		http://libpng.download/src.
   iv)	CImg package only header file (CImg.h) from http://cimg.eu
   v)	Header files of fdeep, eigen, fplus and nlohmann packages from
		https://github.com/Dobiasd/frugally-deep and following the installtion instructions given there.

	The Makefiles expect these packages in local directories according to the following directory tree. 
	If you choose a different place you need to adopt the Makefiles accordingly.
	
		FD-predict
		  include
			zlib-1.2.11 (needed by png package)
			jpeg-9d
			libpng-1.6.37
			CIimg
			eigen3
			fdeep
			fplus
			lohmann
		  lib
		    libjpeg.a  libjpeg.lib  libpng.lib  libpng16.a  libz.a  zlib.lib
	
	For your convenience I have added the needed header files in include and the required libraries in lib. 

1) On Cygwin you need g++, make and the X11 and pthread libraries.

Copy Makefile.cygwin into this directory

    cp Makefiles/Makefile.cygwin Makefile
    make

2) On Windows 10 using the freely available Visual Studio Community

Start the GUI of Visual Studio Community and start a Developer Command Prompt (Tools -> Command Line). In this
Command Prompt window all needed paths are set. We need nmake, cl, lib and link.

Copy Makefile.msw into this directory

    copy Makefiles/Makefile.msw Makefile
    nmake
